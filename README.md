# RCJ-Soccer-2019

This is my program for RoboCup Junior Soccer (Lightweight) Singapore Open 2019 as part of Team Ascension. We finished 4th in the competition, where teams build robots to play robot soccer with an Infrared Ball.

This program was adapted from LJStand, the 2018 Lightweight World Champions from Brisbane Boys' College, Australia. (Their gitbucket can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/ljstand/)
We were inspired by their unique IR ring which could detect the IR signals emitted from the ball very well, which led to them dominating the international competition in 2018.

Our omni-directional soccer robot is run by a Teensy 3.6 (a microprocessor), which we coded on the Arduino platform. 
Our robot's carbon fibre plates are completely self-designed using AutoCad and we also designed our own Printed Circuit Board (PCB) on Eagle.
We also 3D-printed our wheels and fitted them with rubber rollers. We were also planning to integrate an OpenMV M7 Camera for goal detection but was eventually scrapped due to a lack of time.

Many thanks to my teammates Shaoliang and Justin for taking charge of the mechanical and electronic design respectively. A huge shoutout to entire Hwa Chong Robotics community for being supportive and helping me get started on RoboCup programming. :)
